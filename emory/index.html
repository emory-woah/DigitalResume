            <p class="title 1">Versatile Leader Ready</p>
            <p class="paragraph 1">Hello! My name is Emory and I am a queer woman from Long Island, New York. Holding a BA in Mathematics/Computer Science and a BS in Communications, my studied skills include coding, data and media analysis, and public relations. My diverse work portfolio provides a unique set of learned skills and guarantees that I am adaptable. With a great deal of interest in animation, gaming, and a variety of other topics, my unique perspective and individuality makes me a great addition to any team. I am creative, driven, and ready to take on the challenges ahead of me using the skills that I have earned.</p>

          <div class="section 2">
            <p class="title 2">What do I want?</p>
            <p class="paragraph 2">In tune with my varied work experience and interdisciplinary education I have many goals and "wants". This allows me to put my best foot forward in any scenario and make the most of any situation. Two of my main purposes are to educate and entertain, two missions that can be accomplished in any scenario and in a variety of ways. Through management I satisfy my aim to lead and through public relations and analysis I meet the objective of being part of something bigger. These are just a few examples of the many ways that I am driven and goal oriented.</p>

          <div class="section 3">
            <p class="title 3">She/Her & They/Them</p>
            <p class="paragraph 3">I am a queer woman who uses She/Her and They/Them pronouns. This is a large facet of my identity and, appropriately, I will expect it to be respected in any and all professional settings.
              <br>
              <br>
            Historically, I have been known by the misnomer <strike>Alex</strike>. This name exists purely for legal reasons and should not be brought up otherwise.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="section 4">
            <p class="title 4">My Journey</p>
            <p class="paragraph 4">I am the youngest of three raised in a suburban Long Island town. My character was built on the back of my queerness and my identity on that of the media I consumed. After years of theater, honors grades, and executive board duties I had stumbled straight into college and found myself on an odyssey of self-discovery. I trekked to Israel and sifted through propaganda and religious teachings. I worked a Summer in Lake George leading overnight hiking trips. I studied one semester in Ireland and reconnected with my ancestral roots. Now, while receiving two full bachelors degrees amidst a global pandemic, I can say I found Emory Anne Wojtach along the way. A Well-Rounded Jewish & Celtic American Woman capable of anything, ready to adventure.</p>
